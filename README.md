This repository contains my **basic C codes** where I practice and explore different **fundamental concepts of the C programming language**.  
The aim is to **strengthen my programming logic, problem-solving skills, and understanding of system-level programming**. 🚀  

---

## 📌 Topics Covered (so far)  
- 🔢 **Variables & Data Types**  
- 🌀 **Loops & Conditional Statements**  
- 📦 **Functions** – Declaration, definition, and usage  
- 📚 **Arrays & Strings** – Working with collections of data  
- 🎯 **Pointers** – Memory addressing and manipulation  
- 🏗️ **Structures & Unions** – User-defined data types  
- 📂 **File Handling** – Reading and writing files in C  
- 💡 *(More concepts will be added as I continue learning!)*  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- 🔹 **Language**: C (ANSI C, C11 standard where possible)  
- 🔹 **Compiler**: GCC / Clang  
- 🔹 **IDE / Editor**: VS Code / Code::Blocks / any text editor  
- 🔹 **Version Control**: Git & GitHub  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
✔️ Build a strong foundation in **C programming**  
✔️ Practice **low-level programming concepts** like memory & pointers  
✔️ Prepare for **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** in C  
✔️ Use as a **reference repo** for future revision  

---

## 🚀 Future Plans  
- Implement **DSA in C** (Linked List, Stack, Queue, Trees)  
- Explore **Dynamic Memory Allocation (malloc, calloc, free)**  
- Work on **mini projects** (e.g., student record system, calculator, tic-tac-toe in C)  
- Add **commented code snippets** as quick guides  

---

## 🤝 Contributions  
This repo is primarily for my **personal learning**.  
Suggestions, feedback, or improvements are always welcome! 💡
